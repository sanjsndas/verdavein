            <p>This Cookie Policy explains how VerdaVein Irrigation Systems ("Company", "we", "us", and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at verdavein.com ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
            
            <p>In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. In such cases our Privacy Policy (https://verdavein.com/privacy.html) will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.</p>
            
            <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h4>1.1 Definition of Cookies</h4>
                <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, VerdaVein) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).</p>

                <h4>1.2 How We Use Cookies</h4>
                <p>We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are described in detail below.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h4>1.3 Cookie Duration</h4>
                <p>The length of time a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies last only until you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted. We use both session and persistent cookies on our Website. The expiration period for persistent cookies varies according to their purpose - some expire after a few minutes while others may remain for several years unless manually deleted.</p>

                <h4>4.1 Google Analytics</h4>
                <p>We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of our Website. Google Analytics gathers information about website use by means of cookies. The information gathered is used to create reports about the use of our Website. Google's privacy policy is available at https://policies.google.com/privacy. The specific Google Analytics cookies we use include _ga (used to distinguish users, expires after 2 years), _gid (used to distinguish users, expires after 24 hours), and _gat (used to throttle request rate, expires after 1 minute). You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking using their browser add-on.</p>

                <h4>4.2 HubSpot Cookies</h4>
                <p>We use HubSpot for our customer relationship management and marketing automation. HubSpot sets several cookies that help us understand visitor behavior and manage our contacts. These include __hssc (hubspot session cookie, expires after 30 minutes), __hssrc (session cookie, expires when browser closes), and __hstc (main hubspot tracking cookie, expires after 13 months).

This tool uses cookies to track visitors between our site and Facebook. The _fbp cookie is used to identify browsers for advertising purposes (expires after 3 months). The fr cookie contains a unique browser and user ID for tracking (expires after 3 months). You can adjust your Facebook ad preferences or opt out of seeing ads based on your activity on our site through your Facebook settings.

                <p>The LinkedIn Insight Tag is a piece of lightweight JavaScript code that we use to track conversions and retarget website visitors. The tag drops a cookie (lidc) that LinkedIn uses for routing (expires after 1 day) and another (bscookie) that is a secure browser ID cookie (expires after 2 years). This helps us measure the effectiveness of our LinkedIn advertising campaigns. LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes in their account settings.

                <p>We implement a cookie consent mechanism that allows you to accept or decline non-essential cookies when you first visit our Website. Essential cookies cannot be declined as they are necessary for basic functionality. The consent mechanism complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations. Your preferences are stored in a cookie (verda_cookie_consent) so we can remember your choices on subsequent visits (expires after 1 year). You can change your cookie preferences at any time by clicking the "Cookie Settings" link in our footer. We do not load non-essential cookies until consent is given.</p>

You can choose to accept all cookies, reject all non-essential cookies, or customize your preferences by category (e.g., accepting analytics cookies but declining advertising cookies). For each category, we provide a clear description of what the cookies do and who sets them. Your preferences are applied immediately and respected on all pages of our Website.

Withdrawing consent will stop any future processing of your data by non-essential cookies, but will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Some cookies may persist until their natural expiration or until you manually delete them from your browser. After withdrawing consent, you may be prompted again to set your preferences on your next visit. Essential cookies will continue to function regardless of your consent status.</p>

When we transfer your personal data to these providers, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Our third-party cookie providers who receive personal data from the EU have certified their compliance with the Data Privacy Framework or provide alternative appropriate safeguards.

This provides similar protections for UK data subjects as the EU-US framework provides for EU data subjects.

While we do not sell personal information in the traditional sense, some cookie-based advertising activities may constitute "sharing" under these laws. You can opt out of such sharing by using our cookie consent tool to disable advertising cookies or by broadcasting the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal.
